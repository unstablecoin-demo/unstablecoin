# Unstablecoin Repository

## Overview

The Unstablecoin repository houses a demonstration project that showcases the inherent risks in fiat-based stablecoin systems. It is organized into `public` and `docs` directories, each serving distinct roles within the project infrastructure.

## Directories

### `/docs`
Contains site deployed using github pages covering key details on CHOCUSD
- Circulating supply & Reserves
- FAQ on general details on the project
- Learn more section with links to Github, Whitepaper & Redemption Policy

Currently viewable at https://unstablecoin-demo.github.io/unstablecoin/

### `/public`
Contains documentation and resources for public dissemination:
- Overview and intentions of the Unstablecoin project.
- Legal disclaimer and usage warnings.
- Links to testnet deployments of Unstablecoin contracts.
- Descriptions of the ERC20 token contract, roles, and their functions.

## Usage

Navigate to each directory and refer to the respective `README.md` for detailed instructions on the contents and how to use them.

## Note

The `public` directory intentionally omits risk-related details for the purpose of demostration of potential vulnerabilities.
